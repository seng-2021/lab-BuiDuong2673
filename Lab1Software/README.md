I have completed both exercise 1 and exercise 2. 

The code of both exercises are checked by the teachers.
* Exercise 1 and the 1st 2 functions of exercise 2 are checked on Tuesday
* Exercise 2 main function are checked on Friday

I haven't seen any bug in my code.

I start the program by these commands:

Exercise 1
```cmd
python lab3.py 195.148.20.105 20000 "hello there"
```

Exercise 2
```cmd
python lab3Proxy.py 195.148.20.105 20000 "hello there"
```

I didnt' get help from other groups.
